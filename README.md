## The purpose of this repositoty/application

This repository/application was created for a Uni Project, called "Remote Sensing Applications" of the Department of Rural and Surveying Engineering and Geoinformatics Enginnering of the National Technical University of Athens.
    
The aim of this project is, how green spaces are affected by socio-economic factors and land use, with a focus on the case of New York City. For better and more accurate results, two epochs have been investigated, 2011 and 2019.
The application includes a study implementation section with subsections on Luxury Effect, Land Use Effect, and Legacy Effect, and a bibliography. 
The study implementation section includes graphs, charts, and maps to support the analysis. The application concludes that there is a strong correlation between green spaces and median income, 
and suggests further analysis with additional indicators and dynamic maps for more representative results.
The project is made of four Pages. The 1st is about the Datasets that are being used in this project. The 2nd examines how Luxury Effect can affect Urban Green Spaces (UGS) and 
the 3rd and 4th Pages examine how Land Use Effect and Legacy Effect can affect UGS, respectively.  
The Socioeconomic Factors which will be examined are :

    - Mean Income (Luxury Effect)
    - Historic Districts (Legacy Effect)
    - and also - Land Use (Land Use Effect)


## <span style="color:cyan;">Urban Green Spaces</span>

Green spaces are an integral part of urban fabric, and their relationship should be characterized as inseparable. Green spaces refer to areas where vegetation is present, including parks and squares, 
generally providing spaces for residents to freely walk and connect with nature. According to Angelo Siolas (2015), green spaces, also known as "Urban Green Spaces", 
are the points where the city meets nature. Green spaces should be an integral part of every neighborhood, and their distribution should be uniform, with sizes sufficient to meet the needs of all residents.

Numerous studies have shown that green spaces are influenced by various socio-economic factors. Hai-Li Zhang et al. (2021) studied how green spaces depend on property values, 
the history of the area, land uses, and other factors in two different periods. Mendel Giezen (2018) used satellite images to detect a reduction in green spaces over time due to increased construction.
Therefore,the purpose of this study is to identify the correlation between certain socio-economic factors and green spaces in **two time periods** at the level of USA Tract.

It is important to note that in this study, green spaces refer specifically to areas with vegetation. Green spaces in cities offer various benefits that make the relationship between nature and the urban environment 
inseparable. They can act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles. They also reduce the likelihood of flooding by absorbing atmospheric precipitation and help control soil erosion. 
Additionally, green spaces function as noise reduction tools in cities, creating a more pleasant and sustainable living environment for residents. Furthermore, green spaces can be considered as temperature regulators, 
mitigating the heat island effect predominantly found in urban areas. Lastly, they undoubtedly enhance the aesthetics of the city, providing a more visually appealing environment.
